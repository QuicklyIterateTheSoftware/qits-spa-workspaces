 * A URL on this host that this app does not recognise.

 * this host to qits-workspaces on purpose, so an unknown path here is a typo rather than another
 * application's address, and bouncing it back would be a loop.
 *
 * The way out keeps whatever the address said was in scope — a mistyped tail under a repository
 * should not also lose the repository.
