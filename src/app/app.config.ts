/**
 * Four providers, in the order spa-home documents, and the third arrived with this application's
 * first page: `/workspaces/` now makes requests.
 *
 * - `provideBrowserGlobalErrorListeners` funnels genuinely-global errors and unhandled rejections
 *   into Angular's `ErrorHandler`.
 * - `provideRouter` carries the chosen repository in the query parameters, which is what makes one
 *   repository's workspaces bookmarkable.
 * - `withFetch` is not a preference. The default XHR backend is invisible to OTLP fetch
 *   instrumentation, so choosing it would quietly forfeit client spans the moment this deployment
 *   grows a telemetry relay. Every call this app makes is a same-origin path behind the gateway,
 *   which is what lets the browser's session cookie reach `/projects/api/…` from a page served at
 *   `/workspaces/` with no machine token and no CORS.
 * - `provideQitsNavigation` fills the shared layout's sidebar. It issues one `GET /main-navigation`
 *   at startup and hands the answer to `QitsMainLayout`: the platform's door list is the gateway's
 *   answer now, derived from the routes it actually serves, rather than a list compiled into
 *   `@qits/ui-components` that lagged every new application. It rides on the `provideHttpClient`
 *   above — and on the gateway's own root, the one address here that is not under this app's base
 *   path, because it is the only address every SPA can spell the same way.
